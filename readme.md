# Ichitaru Ramen Website

Created website for Ichitaru Ramen Restaurant in Cypress, California. Worked with Weibo Zheng on this project so I was able to gain expereince with collaborating with others in projects. Got more experience in using Git and Github to manage and work together on the project. 

We created this website using ReactJS and I was in charge of the Location component. For this, I got practice in creating a responsive design and added scroll animations for better user experience. I got practice in making different components and passing props across the different components. I also added the loading animation because the high quality pictures that we had caused the site to load a little slower.
